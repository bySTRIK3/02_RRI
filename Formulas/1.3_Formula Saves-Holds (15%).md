## 🧷 **1.3 – Saves + Holds Efficiency (15%)**

This section evaluates **how successful and impactful a reliever has been in generating and converting save and hold opportunities** — with modifiers based on inherited runners and game impact.

---

### ⚙️ A. Efficiency-Based Formula

Instead of raw totals, we now evaluate **efficiency** via percentage-based impact:

```text
RRI_SVH = (Save% × 1.5) + (Hold% × 1.0), capped at +10 RRI points
```

| Term      | Definition                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Save%** | Saves ÷ Save Opportunities                  |
| **Hold%** | Holds ÷ Hold Opportunities (or appearances) |

> 📝 *Use `Relief App with Lead` for better Hold% precision when possible.*

#### 🧮 Example:

| Stat        | Player X |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Saves       | 5        |
| Save Opps   | 6        |
| Holds       | 8        |
| Appearances |          |

```text
Save% = 5 / 6 = 0.833
Hold% = 8 / 15 = 0.533

RRI_SVH = (0.833 × 1.5) + (0.533 × 1.0)
        = 1.25 + 0.533
        = **1.783 → Scaled to 10-point max → Final: ~7.5 pts**
```

### 📌 B. Bonus: Inherited Runners Stranded %

This part boosts or penalizes pitchers based on how they **handle runners on base**, which directly impacts game outcomes.

| IR% Stranded        | RRI Modifier                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **> 85%**           | +2                           |
| **80–85%**          | +1                           |
| **< 70%**           | -2                           |
| \*\* 45% Scored\*\* | ☠️ Add emoji + apply penalty |

### 🎯 C. Clutch Hold or Save Recognition

* Add **+1–2 bonus** if the player earned multiple holds/saves in:

  * **Tie games**
  * **1-run leads**
  * **IR situations with 2+ runners**

> This is applied manually based on **game logs or leverage filters**, often captured in `gmLI > 1.5 + Save/Hold outcome`.

### ⛔ D. Penalty Rules

| Condition                          | Penalty  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Blown Saves > Successful Saves** | -3       |
| **Leads Lost in 8th–9th inning**   | -2       |
| **0-for-5+ in Save/Hold chances**  | -4 to -6 |

---

### 📊 E. Summary Scaling Table

| Performance Tier                     | Total RRI Bonus |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 🟩 Elite (90%+ SV%, 60%+ HLD%)       | +9 to +10       |
| 🟨 Strong (70–89% SV%, 50%+ HLD%)    | +6 to +8        |
| 🟦 Average (60–69% SV%, 40–50% HLD%) | +3 to +5        |
| 🟥 Weak (<60% SV%, <40% HLD%)        | 0 to -3         |
