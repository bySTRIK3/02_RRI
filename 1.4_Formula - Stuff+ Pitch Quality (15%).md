## âš¡ **1.4 â€“ Stuff + Pitching Quality (15%)**

Split into **3 weighted subcomponents**:

---

### ðŸ§ª A. Pitch Quality Composite (Stuff+, Pitching+, Location+) â†’ **7.5%**

> **Formula:**
> Use the **average of Stuff+, Location+, and Pitching+** over the season or past 30 days.

| --------------- | --------- |
| 100â€“110         | +0.25     |
| 111â€“115         | +0.5      |
| 116â€“120         | +1.0      |
| 121â€“125         | +2.0      |
| 126â€“130         | +3.0      |
| 131â€“135         | +4.0      |
| 136â€“140         | +5.0      |
| 141+            | +6.0      |

> You can **weight the average** more toward **Stuff+** if Pitching+ is missing or inconsistent.

### ðŸŽ¯ B. Plate Discipline â€“ CSW% â†’ **3.75%**

> CSW% = **Called Strikes + Whiffs Ã· Total Pitches**

| CSW%      | RRI Bonus |

| 27â€“29%    | 0         |

---

### ðŸŒ€ C. Weighted Pitch Value â€“ Spin Rate Top % â†’ **3.75%**

This accounts for **elite pitch movement or deception**, even if velocity is average.

| Spin Rate Ranking      | RRI Bonus |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| **Top 5%** (any pitch) | +2.5      |
| **Top 10%**            | +1.0      |

* Flag these pitchers with ðŸŒ€ (Spin Rate Badge).
* This value can be applied **per pitch**, but only the **highest-ranking pitch** counts for the bonus.

> Example: Pitcher has Top 5% SL (slider) and Top 10% CH (changeup) â†’ +2.5 only.
