Section 1.2: Leverage and Usage**, which makes up **20% of the Current Season RRI**. This is one of the most important and nuanced parts of the formula because it captures **how teams trust a reliever**, **when they’re used**, and **in what context**.

## 🔍 **1.2 — Leverage & Usage (20%)**

This section blends **Leverage Index (LI)** with actual **usage role type** over the last 14–30 days to create a **Base Role Score**, modified by recent workload patterns and role flexibility.

---

### 🎯 A. Average Leverage Index (Avg\_LI)

> **Source**: FanGraphs `aLI`, `pLI`, `gmLI` over the last 14–30 days (rolling average preferred)

| Avg\_LI Value | Usage Context                          | Role Tier     | Base Role Score |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **≥ 2.0**     | Extreme leverage (elite closers only)  | Tier 10       | **80–95**       |
| **1.5–1.99**  | High-leverage arms used across 7th–9th | HL            | **70–79**       |
| **1.0–1.49**  | Regular setup, mid-to-high leverage    | Setup         | **60–70**       |
| **0.85–0.99** | Medium leverage / occasional high use  | Middle Relief | **45–59**       |
| **< 0.85**    | Low leverage, blowouts, lopsided games | Mop-Up        | **25–40**       |

#### 💡 Adjustments:

* Players **locked into a defined closer role** (with Save% > 70%) get an automatic bump to the **75–90 range**, even if Avg\_LI is slightly below 2.0.
* **Elite leverage scores that drop in past 2 weeks** can be adjusted downward temporarily (e.g., if role shifted).

### 🧱 B. Role-Based Usage Classification

This part aligns the **actual game usage** with **team bullpen structure**:

| Role Type            | Description                               | Base Additive |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 🔒 **Closer**        | 9th inning, defined role, Save% > 60%     | +5            |
| ⏱️ **Setup**         | Regular 8th inning or bridge to closer    | +3            |
| 🧊 **HL Relief**     | Used in top leverage regardless of inning | +4            |
| ⚙️ **Middle Relief** | Regular 6th–7th work, spot appearances    | 0             |
| 🧱 **Long Relief**   | Multi-inning, low leverage                | -3            |
| 🧹 **Mop-Up**        | Blowouts, 5+ run leads/deficits           | -5            |

> ❗ Some pitchers may have overlapping roles. If a pitcher appears in **multiple roles across 10+ games**, apply a **versatility bonus** (see below).

---

### 🧩 C. Role Versatility Bonus

| Usage Variety                             | Bonus  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **10+ appearances across multiple roles** | +3 RRI |
| **15+ appearances across multiple roles** | +5 RRI |

> This rewards pitchers who shift between setup, closing, and middle innings, often trusted in different situations.

---

### 📅 D. Recency Weighting

Favor pitchers who:

* Have **multiple high-leverage appearances in the last 14 days**
* Are **trending upward in gmLI or pLI**
* Just returned from IL or promotion (adjust cautiously if sample <5 outings)

---

### ⚙️ E. Example Calculation:

**Player A (Setup/HL Hybrid):**

* Avg\_LI = 1.65 → Base Score = 74
* Role = HL Relief = +4
* Versatility = 12 appearances in multiple roles = +3
* **Total 1.2 Score = 74 + 4 + 3 = 81**

**Player B (Low Leverage Mop-Up):**

* Avg\_LI = 0.65 → Base Score = 35
* Role = Long Relief = -3
* No versatility bonus
* **Total 1.2 Score = 32**
